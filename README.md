# Computer_Vision-Object_Detection-Scoliosis_demo
An Object Detection, Computer Vision project implemented in PyTorch. 

Description: Given as an input either a frontal or a sagittal x-ray image, 
detect the spinal vertebrae and estimate the Cobb angle, and the shape of the scoliosis.

Models Implemented: 
• SSD-Mobilenetv2
• SSD-ResNet101

Extra Features: 
• Implementation of rotated bounding boxes. 
• Edge detection. 

Please, check the Scoliosis_Presentation.pdf file for short presentation.
